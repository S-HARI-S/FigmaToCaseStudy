# FigmaToCase
Case studies are one of the most important aspect of a UI/UX design. Conveying your design decisions are very important, but also very hectic. This is what we're trying to solve. Here, a person could generate case studies based on their designs using AI. This partially automates the process and give the designer more time to design than thinking how to convey. This act as a base for them to edit and improvise so they don't have to start from scratch. We're also using NotionAPI for creating a notion page which includes the case study. This gives the user the flexibility to edit, share their case studies effortlessly.
